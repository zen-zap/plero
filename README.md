Code-editor with AI code-completion using **OPENAI** API.

Currently, just the file explorer is rendered with a space to view the code. There are no usable features available in the UI yet.
This is how it looks:

## How it Looks:

As you can see there are no other options except for viewing the files. I'll update the demonstration when I have a major improvement to the code.

## Usage:

You'll to make your own OPENAI_API_KEY and other API keys as mentioned in the `demo.env` file at the project root.
Fill in the API keys, rename the file to `.env` and you're good to go.

The services are paid and I can't afford to provide any as a student.

## Contributions:

I won't be going much further with this project once I'm done with the basic working features.
If you want to work on something or have any feature you wanna integrate, feel free to reach out to me.
PRs are welcome.
