Code-editor with AI code-completion using **OPENAI** API.

Yes, you may find a lot of the parts written by AI. 

I'm not a web developer. Any code from AI has been reviewed and iterated upon by me.

## How it Looks: (in Arch -- hyprland compositor)
<img width="1917" height="1052" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cff9370-0263-4d35-a5a4-4268e8860936" />

Appearance may vary depending on window manager, compositor, and theme.

## Current Stage:

You can get ghost completion suggestions when writing code in rust and typescript. Of course, it is not extensively tested with different types on syntax but it works (hopefully).

## Usage:

You'll have to make your own OPENAI_API_KEY and other API keys as mentioned in the `demo.env` file at the project root.
Fill in the API keys, rename the file to `.env` and you're good to go.

The services are paid and I can't afford to provide any as a student.

## Contributions:

I won't be going much further with this project once I'm done with the basic working features.
If you want to work on something or have any feature you wanna integrate, feel free to reach out to me.
PRs are welcome.
